"""Platform configuration: load it, validate it, or refuse to start.

Copy-adapted from ``experiments/integrated-p0/platform_core/config.py``. SEC-003's
rule is still the acceptance scenario, and its source is still
``docs/conventions/secret-setup.md``: a process that cannot resolve its
configuration exits with a non-retryable configuration failure and never
continues on an empty value or a fallback. A platform that silently substitutes a
default is one whose later security evidence means nothing, because nobody can
tell afterwards which configuration actually ran.

Two consequences shape this module, unchanged from P0-A.

* **A default is a documented value for an absent setting, never a repair for a
  rejected one.** ``COSMA_LEASE_SECONDS=0`` is an error, not a reason to use 30.
* **The report names settings, not the environment.** ``secret-setup.md`` lists
  dumping the environment on a configuration error as its own leak channel, so
  the message carries setting names and reasons, and includes an offending value
  only when the setting's name is not itself a candidate secret.

**What DP-032 changes.** P0-A's cluster was repository-local, passwordless, and
reachable only through a Unix socket directory (DP-006 D2); ``db_host`` was a
directory and there was no credential in sight. DP-032 D1/D4 move P1 onto a
dedicated database on a shared server, reached over loopback TCP with a
password: ``db_host`` is now a TCP host string, ``db_port`` is new, and
``db_password_ref`` is new — a *name* in the secret store, resolved at the point
of use by ``platform_core.secrets.resolve_credential``, never a value this
module touches. ``db_password_ref``'s own value is still just a ref name, but its
setting name reads as a secret under ``is_redacted_key``, so a rejected ref is
still withheld from the report by the same rule that protects every other
setting — over-cautious by construction, per the docstring below.

DP-032 D4 also widens the credential-ref naming rule ``secret-setup.md`` fixes
for source credentials (``COSMA_SRC_<SOURCE_ID>_<PURPOSE>``) to a second, sibling
family for database credentials: ``CREDENTIAL_REF_PATTERN`` accepts
``COSMA_SRC_*`` and ``COSMA_DB_*`` and nothing else. P0's own ``domain/outbound.py``
enforced the ``COSMA_SRC_`` half of this at the point an outbound profile was
read; P1 has no outbound-profile layer yet, so the check is enforced once, here,
at config load, and again in ``platform_core.secrets.resolve_credential`` at the
point of resolution — the same two-layer shape P0 used for the secret-store
location guard below.

``SETTINGS`` and ``CROSS_CHECKS`` are tables so that a later validator is an
entry rather than an edit. Two of the entries are security guards rather than
type checks, carried forward unchanged from P0-A:

* ``_loopback_host`` (SEC-002) refuses a non-loopback API bind address instead
  of merely defaulting to loopback. This is about the operator API's own bind
  address, not the database TCP host DP-032 adds — the database is expected to
  be a real, non-loopback-in-general shared server, so ``_loopback_host`` is
  never applied to ``db_host``.
* ``secret_store_location_problem`` (SEC-001) refuses a secret store that
  resolves to somewhere inside the repository working tree. It is the
  application-startup half of the obligation ``docs/conventions/secret-setup.md``
  records; the test-session half lives in ``tests/conftest.py`` and calls this
  same function, so the two cannot drift.

**Reconciliation (M1 Tasks 5-6).** Until now this module carried a minimal,
self-contained stand-in for P0's ``platform_core.errors``/``platform_core.obs``
modules — an inlined ``ConfigurationInvalidError``, log-level validation, and
the secret-aware redaction check this stage needs — because Tasks 3-4 built
configuration, secrets, connection, and migration only, with no error taxonomy
or structured logger yet to import from. Task 6 built the real
``platform_core.errors`` (the full five-class CONTRACT-JOB@0.1 table) and
Task 5 built the real ``platform_core.obs`` (structured logging, redaction,
correlation, metrics); this module now imports ``ConfigurationInvalidError``
from ``platform_core.errors`` and the log-level/redaction helpers from
``platform_core.obs.logging``/``platform_core.obs.redaction`` rather than
carrying its own copies. Behavior is unchanged except that the imported
``ConfigurationInvalidError`` also redacts its own summary text
(``PlatformError.__init__`` applies ``redact_text``) and its detail through
``ProtectedDetail`` (reachable at ``error.detail.for_protected_debug()`` rather
than the old ``error.for_protected_debug()``) — both strictly safer than the
stand-in's "store as given" behavior, and neither changes what any of this
module's own summaries or details expose (no setting name or reason text here
contains a ``key=value`` pattern for the text-masking rule to catch).

Nothing in this module opens a connection, and nothing in it opens the secret
store. SEC-003 requires cases a-e to fail before the database is touched, and the
cheapest way to guarantee that is for the configuration layer to have no database
code in it at all. SEC-001 requires the location guard to decide without reading
the store's **contents**, because reading a credential in order to validate where
it lives would be the leak the rule exists to prevent.
