"""collector.tubedepth.rest — incremental pull from tubedepth's artifacts feed.

Target: tubedepth (yt-scrapper) v1.0.0, `http://127.0.0.1:8080`, fixed by
[DP-031](../../../docs/decisions/DP-031-p1-collector-topology.md) D3 and its
2026-08-21 addendum. See this add-on's README.md for the design this
implements and for two platform-level gaps this add-on cannot work around by
itself (`domain.transport.SocketTransport` is HTTPS-only against a service
that serves plain HTTP; `domain.outbound.resolve` has no per-request path
parameter, which the payload-dereference route needs).

Design (spec Section 5.2):

- `GET /v1/artifacts?since=<watermark>&limit=` paged by tubedepth's own opaque
  keyset `cursor`, newest-`fetched_at`-first (confirmed by reading
  `src/tubedepth/api/application.py` at the target tag: the query orders by
  `Artifact.fetched_at.desc(), Artifact.identifier.desc()`).
- `GET /v1/artifacts/{digest}` dereferences each kept row into one Raw item:
  one payload response is one envelope and one item, payload bytes verbatim.
- This add-on's own cursor (`advance_cursor("artifacts", ...)`) is the
  highest `fetched_at` this run has processed — the first artifact on the
  first page fetched, because the feed is newest-first. It is unrelated to
  tubedepth's own per-page pagination cursor, which never leaves this run.
- `item_key = kind|target|fetched_at` — `digest` is a content address, not an
  observation identifier (two different `fetched_at` rows can share one
  digest when nothing changed).
- 404 (aged out of the 30-day retention window), 409 (schema version never
  recorded and the kind has withdrawn one) and 410 (retracted) on the
  dereference route are `context.accept_status` data outcomes, counted and
  skipped rather than treated as failures.
- `since`/`until` on this target require an RFC 3339 timestamp with a
  timezone offset (measured against the live instance, tubedepth 1.0.3: a
  naive `since` is refused with 422 `invalid_request`); tubedepth's own
  `fetched_at` is always `Z`-suffixed, so a watermark round-tripped from a
  previous response already satisfies this.
