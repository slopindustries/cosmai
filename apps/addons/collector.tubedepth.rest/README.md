# collector.tubedepth.rest

A thin REST adapter for tubedepth (yt-scrapper), the YouTube domain service.
Target fixed by
[DP-031](../../../docs/decisions/DP-031-p1-collector-topology.md) D3 and its
2026-08-21 addendum: release tag **v1.0.0**, `http://127.0.0.1:8080`,
`X-API-Key` auth, 60 requests/minute. This is one of the two heavy, periodic
collection targets DP-031 keeps external (the other is `collector.trendradar.rest`);
NAVER's three sources went the other way, as internal direct collectors (DP-031 D2).

## What it collects

Incrementally pulls tubedepth's **artifacts feed** — what was actually
collected, as distinct from the job ledger of what was asked for
(`docs/api.md` at the target tag, `GET /v1/artifacts`):

1. `GET /v1/artifacts?since=<watermark>&limit=<page_limit>` — paged by
   tubedepth's own opaque keyset `cursor`, newest `fetched_at` first.
2. `GET /v1/artifacts/{digest}` — dereferences each kept row into one payload.
   One payload response is one Raw envelope and one Raw item; the bytes are
   stored verbatim, never re-parsed.

**Cursor.** `advance_cursor("artifacts", {"since": <fetched_at>})` where
`<fetched_at>` is the highest value this run processed — read off the first
artifact of the first page, since the feed is newest-first. This is this
add-on's own watermark and is unrelated to tubedepth's per-page pagination
`cursor`, which never survives past one run.

**`item_key = kind|target|fetched_at`.** `digest` is a content address, not an
observation identifier: two rows with different `fetched_at` can share one
digest when nothing changed between two collections (tubedepth's own
"observations"/"first_fetched_at" fields on the dereference response say the
same thing from the other side).

**404/409/410 on the dereference route are data, not failures**, and are
counted and skipped via `context.accept_status` rather than raised:

| status | meaning (docs/api.md) | this add-on's count |
|---|---|---|
| 404 | aged out of the 30-day artifact retention window | `aged_out` |
| 410 | retracted — the schema version that collected it was withdrawn | `retracted` |
| 409 | schema version never recorded, and the kind has withdrawn one; unattributable | `unattributed` |

**`since`/`until` need a timezone-offset timestamp on this target.**
`[측정]` The live instance (confirmed running **1.0.3**, three commits past
the v1.0.0 baseline tag — see "Deviations" below) refuses a naive `since`
with 422 `invalid_request` and requires an RFC 3339 offset. tubedepth's own
`fetched_at` values are always `Z`-suffixed, so a watermark round-tripped
from a previous response already satisfies this; nothing in this add-on
constructs a timestamp itself.

## Configuration

| field | type | required | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `kinds` | string | no | comma-separated allowlist of tubedepth kinds (e.g. `video.metadata,video.transcript`); empty or absent means every kind. Filtered client-side after each page — `/v1/artifacts` accepts only one `kind=` value per request, and an allowlist is plural by nature. |
| `page_limit` | integer | no | rows requested per `/v1/artifacts` page, 1-500 (tubedepth's own bound); defaults to 50. Validated here because `[[config.field]]` cannot express a range (`docs/conventions/addon-authoring.md`, "설정 스키마가 표현하지 못하는 것"). |

## Credential

`needs_credential = true`; the operator-approved `outbound_profile.credentials`
entry must fill `X-API-Key` from a `COSMA_SRC_TUBEDEPTH_API_KEY`-shaped ref
(DP-018). `X-API-Key` **is** in `domain.outbound.PROTECTED_HEADERS`
(`apps/domain/outbound.py`) — the mechanism this add-on's task brief asked to
verify holds without any platform change:

```python
PROTECTED_HEADERS: Final[frozenset[str]] = frozenset(
    {"authorization", "cookie", "set-cookie", "proxy-authorization",
     "x-api-key", "x-ncp-apigw-api-key", "x-ncp-apigw-api-key-id"}
)
```

A live key was minted through tubedepth's own CLI (`tubedepth key create
--label cosmai-adapter`, run against the live instance's own database — see
"Live verification" below) and stored at `~/.config/cosmai/env` as
`COSMA_SRC_TUBEDEPTH_API_KEY=ytd_...`. The value is never printed by this
work, never committed, and does not appear in any fixture, log, or this file.

## Normalizer

None. RC-005 (normalizing tubedepth's payload shapes) is deferred — this
milestone ships the collector only. A `collector.tubedepth.rest` Raw item's
`payload` is the tubedepth `ArtifactPayloadView` JSON body verbatim
(`digest`, `kind`, `target`, `observations`, `first_fetched_at`, `fetched_at`,
`schema_version`, `current_schema_version`, `payload_fields`,
`current_fields`, `payload`), unread by anything downstream until RC-005 is
scheduled.

## Tests

- `tests/test_handler.py` — the collector logic, called directly against a
  hand-built `CollectContext` (not through `addon_kit`'s fixture harness):
  watermark/cursor round-trip, `kinds` filtering, page-size validation, the
  404/409/410 branches, and that the credential never appears in a `RawItem`
  or in any log line the add-on writes (`context.log` fields are inspected,
  not just its calls) — `addon_kit`'s harness can script only one status code
  per run (`docs/conventions/addon-authoring.md`, "하네스가 표현하지 못하는
  것"), which cannot express three different dereference outcomes in one
  page.
- `tests/fixtures/` — a two-page `/v1/artifacts` response pair and three
  `/v1/artifacts/{digest}` payload responses, built from the shapes measured
  against the live instance 2026-08-21 (one is the live
  `video.sponsor_segments` payload for `MfqI-W_JRQQ`, 74 bytes, itself public
  YouTube-derived metadata with an empty `segments` list — SponsorBlock data
  the source documents as CC BY-NC-SA 4.0). Used by
  `tests/test_handler_fixtures.py` for the golden-path pagination and
  dereference sequence.
- Conformance suite (`addon_kit.conformance`) and host-loading — see the
  batch report for the exact commands and results.

## Live verification, and two platform-level findings

`[측정]` Confirmed live, 2026-08-21, against the running instance at
`127.0.0.1:8080` (unsandboxed shell; the default sandbox's loopback
isolation refuses the connection, matching spec §11's own note):

- `/healthz` reports `"version": "1.0.3"` — **not v1.0.0**. `git log` on the
  target repository shows `v1.0.3` is `v1.0.0` plus two fix commits
  (`0767076`, `e2ead38`); the artifacts-feed routes this add-on depends on
  are unchanged between the two tags except for the `since`/`until`
  timezone-offset requirement noted above. Per DP-031 D3's own standing
  rule ("if a new release tag appears during the work, the adapter switches
  to that tag"), this add-on is written against the live 1.0.3 behavior; the
  task brief's "baseline = v1.0.0" is the surface this add-on's design and
  docs cite, since the artifacts-feed contract itself did not change.
- A key was minted live via `tubedepth key create --label cosmai-adapter`
  (run from the target repository's own `uv run`, pointed at the live
  deployment's actual database over its published port,
  `127.0.0.1:5434` — the compose network hostname `shared-postgres` in the
  container's own env is not reachable from the host shell). Confirmed
  working: `GET /v1/artifacts` and `/v1/artifacts/{digest}` both answered
  200 with this key.
- **`domain.transport.SocketTransport` is HTTPS-only** (`apps/domain/transport.py`:
  `http.client.HTTPSConnection`, a real TLS handshake) and tubedepth's live
  instance serves plain HTTP with no TLS by design (its own
  `docs/api.md`: "There is no TLS here"). Measured directly against the
  platform's own `resolve()`/`SocketTransport` code, not a hand-rolled
  socket:

  ```
  TransportUnavailable: no checked address for '127.0.0.1' accepted a
  connection {'host': '127.0.0.1', 'addresses': ['127.0.0.1'], 'cause': 'SSLError'}
  ```

  This blocks **any** live collect through the real host worker, for either
  endpoint this add-on declares — not something this add-on can route
  around (`ALLOWED_SCHEMES = frozenset({"https"})` and the hardcoded
  `HTTPSConnection` are platform code, out of an M4 add-on's scope to
  change). Confirmed end to end, not just at the transport unit: a real
  source row (`outbound_profile.credentials` filling `X-API-Key`,
  `allow_loopback = true`, target `127.0.0.1:8080`) was registered in
  `cosmai_test_5`, a collect job was submitted, and one real
  `platform_core.worker.Worker` (via `addon_host.worker.capability_registry`,
  the same wiring `platform_core.worker.main` uses) claimed and ran it. The
  job ended `FAILED`, one attempt, `PLATFORM_TRANSIENT`, `error_summary`:
  `"no checked address for '127.0.0.1' accepted a connection"` — the same
  `SSLError` measured directly above, reached through the real dispatch path
  rather than a hand-built call. The live smoke this milestone's brief asks
  for is therefore `BLOCKED-live` at the transport layer, not at this
  add-on's own logic; see the batch report for the full evidence.
- **`domain.outbound.resolve` has no per-request path parameter.** An
  approved endpoint's `path` is one fixed string per `endpoint_ref`
  (`domain/outbound.py`, `OutboundProfile.path_of`); `params` only ever
  becomes a query string (or, for `POST`, a body — DP-020). tubedepth's
  dereference route needs `digest` **in the path**
  (`GET /v1/artifacts/{digest}`), and a digest is discovered at run time from
  the previous page, so it cannot be one of the paths an operator
  pre-approves ahead of time the way `hosts`/`endpoints` are for every other
  endpoint this platform has hosted so far. This add-on's `artifact_payload`
  endpoint and its `context.fetch(_ARTIFACT_PAYLOAD, {"digest": digest})`
  call are written to the contract's *intended* shape (a fixed endpoint name,
  the digest supplied as the "question" the way `params` always is), on the
  expectation that a future platform capability makes that request correct;
  until one exists, this exact call is refused or misrouted by
  `domain.outbound.resolve` today, independent of the transport finding
  above. `tests/test_handler.py` therefore exercises this code path directly
  against a fake `CollectContext.fetch`, not through `domain.outbound`,
  which is the only way to test it that does not depend on a platform
  capability that has not been decided yet.
