"""The socket half of the guard, against a real server — and `collector.naver.blog` on it.

`test_outbound_policy.py` covers everything `domain.outbound` can decide without a socket,
which is most of it. What is left needs one: a name that resolves, a connection that opens,
bytes that keep arriving, and a clock that runs out. `SEC-004` is entirely in that half —
"oversized/slow response는 bounded failure로 종료되고 worker를 무기한 점유하지 않는다" is
not a claim a pure function can make.

**The known obstacle, decided in advance.** `EXP-003` records it: the DNS rule blocks
loopback, so a local stub is unreachable through the production path unless something is
relaxed. What is relaxed is the per-source `allow_loopback` flag, and the experiment record
fixed the price in advance — **two** tests, not one. `TestLoopbackIsOnlyReachableByFlag`
holds both: with the flag off a loopback address is actually refused, and no source in the
repository sets it. The first is the positive control without which the second proves
nothing.

**The certificate.** The stub speaks real TLS with a certificate generated per session, and
`SocketTransport` takes its `ssl.SSLContext` as a constructor argument. That is a
*per-process* trust anchor and not a per-source one: no `source` row, profile field, or
environment variable can widen it, and `test_the_default_context_rejects_this_stub` is the
control proving the trust is doing work rather than being absent.

Copy-adapted from `experiments/integrated-p0/tests/test_outbound_transport.py` (M2 batch
2c). One class is **not** carried over: P0's `TestTheInstalledCollectorRunsThroughThePlatform`
ran the installed `addons/collector.naver.blog` through `JobRunner`, the capability layer,
this transport, a socket, and the database — every one of those except this module's own
`domain.transport` is M3 (`addon_host`) or M4 (the add-on itself) work that does not exist
in this tree yet. That class, its two fixtures (`domain`, `ncp_store`), and its two helpers
(`register_stub_source`, `run_the_installed_collector`) are omitted rather than stubbed;
`docs/p1/M2-RECORD.md` names the omission and the M3/M4 batches it belongs to. Every other
class here needs only `domain.outbound`/`domain.transport` and the stub server below, which
this tree's `domain` package (this batch) already provides.
