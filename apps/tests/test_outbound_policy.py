"""The outbound policy, rule by rule.

Copy-adapted from ``experiments/integrated-p0/tests/test_outbound_policy.py`` (M2 batch
2c), verbatim. No fixture, no database, and no P0-specific import: every case here is a
pure function of a URL, a profile, and (for the address rule) a list of strings, so
nothing about this tree's fixture names or schema qualification applies.

`p0-security.md` §Outbound lists six obligations and DP-008 D4 puts every one of them on
the platform. Each has a test here that shows it **refusing**, and — where the assertion
is an absence — a positive control showing the same code path accepting. A rule that
never accepted anything would pass every refusal test while blocking all real work, and
a rule that never refused would pass nothing at all yet look identical in a summary line.

None of these open a socket. That is the point of separating policy from transport: a
security test that needs a server standing up is a security test that eventually gets
skipped.

    `apps/tests/conftest.py`'s session-scoped autouse `_reset_schema` opened a database
    connection before a single test in this file ran, gating an otherwise DB-free
