"""The socket half of the outbound guard: one hop, bounded, connected where it was checked.

Copy-adapted from ``experiments/integrated-p0/domain/transport.py`` (M2 batch 2c),
verbatim — nothing here touches the database or a schema, and its only local import
(``domain.outbound``) resolves the same way in this tree. Deadline semantics, the
one-hop/no-redirect-follow rule, and the read/write bound sequencing are unchanged.

`domain.outbound` is deliberately decidable without a socket — every rule there is a
function of a URL, a profile, and a list of addresses. This module is what is left over:
a name to resolve, a connection to make, bytes to read, and a clock to run out. It is
separate for the reason `outbound` states, which is that a policy testable only against a
live network is a policy nobody re-tests.

Three properties are this module's and not `outbound`'s.

**It connects to the address it checked.** `getaddrinfo` runs once, every address it
returned is put through :func:`~domain.outbound.check_resolved_addresses`, and the socket
is opened to one of *those* addresses with the approved hostname carried separately for
TLS and for `Host`. Checking a name and then connecting by name is a rebinding hole: the
second lookup can answer differently from the first, and nothing in a passing test would
show it.

**It follows no redirect.** One call is one hop. A `3xx` comes back with its `Location`
unfollowed, because revalidating a redirect is `outbound.check_redirect`'s and a transport
that quietly followed one would be a second, looser policy nobody wrote down.

**It stops.** One monotonic deadline bounds every connection attempt, the request write, and
every read; the size limit is enforced while reading rather than after. So `SEC-004`'s
"oversized/slow response는 bounded failure로 종료되고 worker를 무기한 점유하지 않는다" holds
against a server that never stops **sending**, one that never **starts**, and one that will
not **receive**.

`[측정]` All three halves were false at some point and the history is worth reading before
changing anything here. `ADVERSARIAL-REVIEW-2026-08-18.md` F5: the bound was a socket timeout,
which bounds each `recv`, while `_read_bounded` called `read(n)`, which blocks until *n* bytes
arrive — occupancy **linear in `max_response_bytes`**, about 38 days against `DEFAULT_LIMITS`.
`ADVERSARIAL-REVIEW-2026-08-19.md` F1: the deadline was armed *after*
`connection.request(...)`, so the write ran under the connect-time timeout alone — a `send()`
occupying 18.83s against a 0.5s budget. A bound that scales with the thing it bounds is not a
bound, and a bound that covers three of a request's four phases is not one either.

`[측정]` Two more multipliers sat on top of F5's and both are gone with it: `_connect`
applied `connect_timeout_s` per address, and the caller's redirect loop gave each hop its own
full read.

The TLS context is a constructor argument whose default is `ssl.create_default_context()`.
That is how a test reaches a stub with its own certificate authority without any source
row, profile field, or environment variable being able to widen the policy — a
*per-process* trust anchor rather than a *per-source* one. `tests/test_outbound_transport.py`
holds the positive control: the same stub under the default context fails to verify.

**M4x, plain HTTP — the second half of the belt-and-suspenders rule.** `domain.outbound`
grants `request.scheme == "http"` only when the profile set `allow_loopback`, and that
grant is stated before a socket ever opens. It cannot be the whole rule: `allow_loopback`
is a flag a profile *states*, and the address it is actually about to connect to is only
known after `resolve_addresses` runs — the same DNS gap `outbound.py`'s own docstring
names for `check_resolved_addresses`. So this module holds the second check: before it
will open a plain-HTTP connection, every address `send` resolved must itself be loopback,
regardless of what the profile claims. A name that answered loopback once and something
else the second time is exactly the rebinding hole this module's own opening paragraph
already refuses to create for TLS; the same connect-to-what-was-checked discipline applies
here without a certificate to fall back on.
